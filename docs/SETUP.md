# TRegGA: Initial setup

- First, if you have not already done so, download TRegGA and install all software prerequisites (see **[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)**).
  You can execute `bash check-prereqs.sh` in your terminal to verify whether all prerequisites are installed correctly.
- Next, make sure TRegGA has been configured correctly for your particular system (see **[CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md)**).
- Finally, execute `bash setup.sh` in your terminal.
  This will download and preprare reference genomes and other ancillary data required by the TRegGA workflow.
