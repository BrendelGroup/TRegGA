Makefile_TRegGA-orig is the master makefile to run the complete TRegGA workflow, from
read preparation to de novo assembly and reference-guided assembly.  The individual steps
(read preparation; target selection; de novo assembly; reference-guided assembly) can
be executed individually using the master makefile with pertinent targets or by running
appropriately edited makefiles in the respective subdirectories.  Using the master
makefile facilitates the process by editing 0Record-* scripts that in turn create and
run subtask makefiles.

The dependency structure of the subtasks is as follows:

reads  -> target
  |    \     |
  |     \    |
  >      >   >
denovo -> rfguided

The all-in-one excution should work well in standard cases.  Fine tuning of parameters
may best be done by editing copies of the subtask makefiles.

The following variables must be set in a copy of Makefile_TRegGA-orig:

CHECKONLY	yes [default] or no [means that you actually want to run make]
NUMPROC		e.g., 8

CULTIVAR	e.g., "DA GANG ZHAN"
SYNONYM		e.g., Dagangzhan

TARGET		e.g., NbSWEET13
REFERENCE	e.g., OsjCHR12
FROM		e.g., 17290000
TO		e.g., 17320000

From the commandline, the entire workflow could be executed as follows:


	make CHECKONLY=yes NUMPROC=8 CULTIVAR='\"DA GANG ZHAN\"' SYNONYM=Dagangzhan TARGET=NbSWEET13 REFERENCE=OsjCHR12 FROM=17290000 TO=17320000 -d -f Makefile_TRegGA-orig >& showme


Because we set CHECKONLY=yes, this command should only print to file "showme" what will be executed.
(Note: CHECKONLY=yes is the default, so you could leave out this argument for the same result.)
The "-d" flag to make is optional.  It will show the dependencies.

	egrep "remake" showme

will list all the targets that need to be remade.

In detail, what is meant to be executed is the following:
1) In reads:
	Create a script file 0Record-Dagangzhan and run the script.  This will create a
	subdirectory Dagangzhan, put Makefile_GPR_Dagangzhan in that directory, and run it.
2) In targets:
	Create a script file 0Record-NbSWEET13 and run the script.  This will create
	files NBSWEET13.*, needed for the reference-guided assembly.
3) In assembly/denovo:
	Create a script file 0Record-Dagangzhan and run the script.  This will create a
	subdirectory Dagangzhan, put Makefile_denovo_Dagangzhan in that directory, and run it.
4) In assembly/rfguided:
	Create a script file 0Record-Dagangzhan-on-NbSWEET13 and run the script.  This
	will create a subdirectory Dagangzhan-on-NbSWEET13, put
	Makefile_RGA_Dagangzhan-on-NbSWEET13 in that directory, and run it.

If all looks ok, then to run make, simply replace the CHECKONLY=yes with CHECKONLY=no (and leave out the -d):

	make CHECKONLY=no NUMPROC=8 CULTIVAR='\"DA GANG ZHAN\"' SYNONYM=Dagangzhan TARGET=NbSWEET13 REFERENCE=OsjCHR12 FROM=17290000 TO=17320000 -f Makefile_TRegGA-orig >& err

Notes:
- The CULTIVAR argument must be in quotes (allowing spaces).
- The SYNONYM argument must be a single word (no spaces, special characters allowed).
- The TARGET argument should uniquely identify the target specified by REFERENCE, FROM - TO range.
  If you want to change the range later, then use a different label or remove the existing TARGET.*
  files in subdirectory targets.


Targets for the subtasks are identified by the following files:

reads		${TRegGA_DIR)/reads/SYNONYM/SYNONYM_1.fa
targets		${TRegGA_DIR}/targets/TARGET.embl
denovo		${TRegGA_DIR}/assembly/denovo/SYNONYM/SYNONYM-GF/SYNONYM-GF.gapfilled.final.fa
rfguided	${TRegGA_DIR}/assembly/rfguided/SYNONYM-on-TARGET/Makefile_rfguided_SYNONYM-on-TARGET

where ${TRegGA_DIR} is the TRegGA home directory, and SYNONYM and TARGET are appropriately substituted.
Thus

	make CHECKONLY=no NUMPROC=16 CULTIVAR='\"DA GANG ZHAN\"' SYNONYM=Dagangzhan -f Makefile_TRegGA-orig ${TRegGA_DIR)/reads/Dagangzhan/Dagangzhan_1.fa

would use 16 processors to prepare the Dagangzhan reads (and do no more).

	make CHECKONLY=no NUMPROC=12 CULTIVAR='\"DA GANG ZHAN\"' SYNONYM=Dagangzhan -f Makefile_TRegGA-orig ${TRegGA_DIR)/assembly/denovo/Dagangzhan/Dagangzhan-GF/Dagangzhan-GF.gapfilled.final.fa

would use 12 processors to run the Dagangzhan de novo assembly (preparing the reads, unless already present;
but do no more than the de novo assembly).

	make CHECKONLY=no TARGET=NbEL2 REFERENCE=OsjCHR3 FROM=460000 TO=480000 -f Makefile_TRegGA-orig ${TRegGA_DIR}/targets/NbEL2.embl >& err

would produce the files for a new target (NbEL2).

	make CHECKONLY=no NUMPROC=8 CULTIVAR='\"DA GANG ZHAN\"' SYNONYM=Dagangzhan TARGET=NbEL2 REFERENCE=OsjCHR3 FROM=460000 TO=480000 -f Makefile_TRegGA-orig >& err

would use 8 processors to run the reference-guided assembly of Dagangzhan on this second target (NbEL2),
using the existing reads and de novo assembly.

TRegGA-INSTALL contains general installation instructions for the programs used by TRegGA. 

TRegGA.config contains TRegGA runtime configuration for program locations that needs to be included into makefiles. TRegGA.config.mason is specific to Mason.indiana.edu, and should replace TRegGA.config before TRegGA execution.

TRegGA.source contains TRegGA runtime configuration for program locations that needs to be included into shell environment. TRegGA.source.mason is specific to Mason.indiana.edu, and should replace TRegGA.source before TRegGA execution.
