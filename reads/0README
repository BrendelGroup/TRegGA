"reads" directory

subdirectories correspond to the named cultivars; files <LABEL>/*_1.fq and <LABEL>/*_2.fq
are trimmed, quality-controlled reads for use in subsequent analyses.

Use "xgetreads" for simplified retrieval of sequence information (and fastq data, as needed).
For help, type

xgetreads
