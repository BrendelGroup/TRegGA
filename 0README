A typical TRegGA workflow involves:

- read, reference, and target preparation

- assembly (de novo and reference-guided)

These steps are documented in the aptly named sub-directories:

- reads:	contains NGS reads to be assembled; see reads/0README
		and instructions in ../TRegGA/reads

- reference:	contains subdirectories rice_indica and rice_japonica,
		with documented sequence retrieval and processing

- targets:	contains target sequences derived; typically, these
		targets would be derived from reference sequences by
		specifying a particular region (and transferring the
		annotation to the new coordinate system)

- assembly/denovo:	SOAPdenovo2 assemblies of reads to contigs
			and scaffolds, optionally gap-filled with
			GapFiller

- assembly/rfguided:	reference-guided assemblies of reads using
			the specified target as a template; this
			step involves AlignGraph, ABACAS,
			GapFiller, and RATT
