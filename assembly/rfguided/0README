TRegGA Step 3: reference-assisted assembly of reads.

!!! UNEDITED TEXT VERSION FROM Chun-Yuan:

Use an edited version of the template Makefile_RGA-orig to assemble contigs and
scaffolds against user-defined target genome region (AlignGraph), then generate
a pseudomolecule based on the targeted reference genome region (ABACAS). Lastly,
it annotates the new assembly by transferring those from the reference (RATT),
with optional annotation via spliced alignments (GenomeThreader). Several
steps are evaluated for assembly qualities such as contig N50 and gene numbers (QUAST). 

You should carefully select AlignGraph and RATT options appropriate to your
particular data sets.

Usage demonstration:

1) ./xdemo

    will generate Makefile_RGA-demo
   
	make -j X -f Makefile_RGA-demo >& err
 
	where X is the number of processors available.


2) ./xdemo-cleanup

	will clean up the current directory to its original state, deleting the demo files.
